**Project Name:**
Clustering/Classification Analysis

## Description

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook (`app.ipynb`) to analyze a dataset where each record is assigned to a cluster and a class. The primary goal is to explore the relationship between clusters and class labels, typically for clustering evaluation or anomaly detection.

## Table Structure

The main output is a table with the following columns:

- **Class**: The ground truth or target label (values: 0, 1)
- **Cluster**: The assigned cluster for each record

The table summarizes the count of records for each combination of class and cluster.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Notebook:**
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `app.ipynb`.
2. **Review the Analysis:**
The notebook contains code and markdown cells that:
    - Load and preprocess the data
    - Perform clustering or classification
    - Generate summary tables and possibly visualizations
3. **Run the Notebook:**
Execute each cell in order to reproduce the results.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (`pip install notebook`)
- Required Python libraries:
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`
    - (Any other libraries used in the notebook)

To install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```


## Data

- **Input:**
The notebook expects input data in a specific format (details in the notebook).
- **Output:**
The main output is a summary table showing the distribution of class labels across clusters.


## Results

The table output in the notebook shows how many records of each class fall into each cluster. This is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the clustering or classification method.

Example table format (from your file):


| Cluster | Class 0 | Class 1 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| -1 | 6875 | 24 |
| 0 | 877 | 0 |
| 1 | 27 | 0 |
| ... | ... | ... |
